Balsamiq does not offer professional services such as on-site training, implementation, or software customizations. If you are looking for Balsamiq experts who can, [try this list of resources](/resources/lookingforhelp/).

We also don't have the resources to do live demonstrations or training, but we do have many demo videos and tutorials available on our web site. Some good places to visit are our **[Tutorials](/tutorials/)**, the [Mockups documentation](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/), and the [myBalsamiq documentation](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/).

If you are new to Mockups, you might want to start with our **[intro demo video](/tutorials/introvideo/)**, followed by our [tutorial on creating your first mockup](/tutorials/firstmockup/).

We also published the following two **online courses**, which are great for beginners:

*   [Wireframing with Balsamiq Mockups](https://www.udemy.com/wireframing-with-balsamiq-mockups/) on Udemy
*   [Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Rapid-Wireframing-Finding-the-Right-Product-Design/1947996659) on SkillShare

In addition we have demos up on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVlyYfbClWxRpOSJvalIUTBxoqkrzowzI). There is also a book on using Mockups called ["Balsamiq Wireframes Quickstart Guide"](/resources/books/).

And if you ever run into problems, don't hesitate to **[contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/#contact)** for help!
