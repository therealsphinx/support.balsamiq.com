We can understand the desire to engage in any litigation in a local and familiar legal system. No doubt, for many of the same reasons, we feel the same way too.

Although we can’t change this clause, we can say that the US legal system is a world class legal system and will offer protection and justice should the situation arise.

That said, we have never entered into any litigation with any of our customers.
