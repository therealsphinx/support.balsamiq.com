## Licenses

We encourage Mockups for Confluence Server and Mockups for JIRA Server customers to purchase from Atlassian Marketplace, but you can also purchase directly from us.
Here's [all the info](/sales/marketplace/).

The easiest and fastest way to purchase a license for Mockups 3 for Desktop is by credit card on our [website](https://balsamiq.com/buy/).

Once that is done, you will receive your License Information via the email address you entered when purchasing, along with a link to view, edit, or download the invoice for your purchase.

For orders of US $300 or more, we also accept checks and Electronic Fund Transfers.

Here's how: [generate a quote](/sales/quote/) for the product you'd like, including your company's billing information, and if applicable, any reference or [PO number](/sales/purchaseorders/). Email us the completed quote and we'll email you back your License Information and invoice. Our Terms are Net 30.
