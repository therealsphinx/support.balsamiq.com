This page will cover the differences in editor versions. Check out our [Compare Page](https://balsamiq.com/products/compare/) if you need a more in-depth view about each product.

## Editor Versions

We currently have two different versions of the Balsamiq Mockups editor (the part of our application where you create and edit mockups).

First, there is [Mockups Version 3 Editor](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), the new kid on the block that we debuted with [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/). It's been rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate new features and an eventual shift to all native-based applications.

The other is the original Mockups Version 2 editor that served as the engine for all of our products until recently. While it's slowly being phased out in favor of the version 3 editor, it still has a lot of chops. We don't update it as often as the version 3 editor, but it still gets plenty of love - and it's as powerful as ever!

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor

1. [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/)
2. [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/)
3. [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/#mockups-3-for-confluence-cloud)
3. [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/#mockups-3-for-jira-cloud)

Any products based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor will be updated simultaneously whenever we release a [new version](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/) (you'll have to [manually download](https://balsamiq.com/download) the desktop app).

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor

1. [myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/)
2. [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/#mockups-2-for-confluence-server)
3. [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/#mockups-2-for-jira-server)

These three applications will work almost identically, save for one major difference: The Atlassian Plugins based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor (Confluence Server and JIRA Server) do not support the creation of [symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/symbols/). This is due to a limitation in the way the plugins were initially implemented.

## Editor Differences

The main difference between the version 2 and version 3 editors is that the version 3 editor uses our new project file format ([BMPR](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/#what-s-new-in-balsamiq-mockups-3)). This allows all of your mockups, assets, and symbols to live in a single file, [making sharing even easier](https://support.balsamiq.com/desktop/sharing/)!

The version 3 editor will also get updated more frequently, and has new features added to it with every release. The version 2 editor won't see all of those features. As much as we love the version 2 editor, we hope to have all of our products on the version 3 editor soon!
