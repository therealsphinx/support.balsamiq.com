This article is for our Mockups 3 for Desktop customers who are interested in either adding access to Mockups 3 for Google Drive or switching from Desktop to Google Drive altogether.

## Complementary Products

We consider Mockups 3 for Desktop and Mockups 3 for Google Drive to be complementary products. Depending on your situation, you may or may not want to purchase both. Read on for our suggestions.

We see Mockups 3 for Desktop as the preferred tool for power-users or for extended or offline usage, while Mockups 3 for Google Drive is optimized for sharing and collaborating or working away from your own computer.

Another thing to consider is that Mockups 3 for Google Drive's entry price of just $5/month, with subscriptions that can be stopped and restarted at any time, makes it accessible to a lot more people who wouldn't normally be able to afford Mockups.

## Use Mockups for Google Drive for Free as a Viewer

We structured our Mockups 3 for Google Drive licensing so that after the 30-day trial is over, you (or your clients) will still be able to open any and view Mockups files stored on Google Drive. However, you will not be able to edit or create new mockups unless you sign up for a [paid plan](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#signing-up-for-a-subscription).

## Try It Out!

If you already use Mockups 3 for Desktop, our suggestion is to add Mockups 3 for Google Drive for a month or two (on the $5/month plan) and to try it out. If you notice that you use both depending on what you need to do, great. If instead you see that you never use Mockups 3 for Desktop any more, just go ahead and uninstall it, send us the email address you're using for Mockups 3 for Google Drive (to [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com)) and we'll try to make you happy with a few months of free Mockups 3 for Google Drive service.
