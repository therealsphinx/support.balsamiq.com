Though we do offer a few standard [discounts](/sales/discounts/), we rarely use _discount codes_ for those programs.

We only use discount codes to give credit as part of our [desktop and plugin user discount](/sales/atlassianplugindiscounts/) and in other exceptional circumstances.

**Please DO NOT email us asking for a promotional discount code, we never have those.**

Instead, have a look to see if you qualify for one of our standard [discounts](/sales/discounts/) or are eligible for one of our [free software](https:/balsamiq.com/free) programs.
