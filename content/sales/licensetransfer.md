Our Mockups 3 for Desktop licenses are named and transferable, meaning that if one of your employees leaves you may recycle that license to a different user.

Transferring a license is very easy:

1.  Select "Unregister from this Computer..." from the Balsamiq Mockups Help menu on all the computers of the person that’s no longer going to use it.
2.  [Download and Install Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download) on the new user’s machine and use your License Information (the one you received via email or invoice) to register it.

That's it!

Here’s a little screenshot of all the different screens you’ll be seeing (click on the image to enlarge it):

## Transferring to a New Machine as the Same User?

Our licenses are tied to you, not a particular machine, so just go ahead and register Balsamiq Mockups on your new machine with your old License Information. If you will no longer be the user on the old machine, follow the instructions above to un-register Mockups on it.
