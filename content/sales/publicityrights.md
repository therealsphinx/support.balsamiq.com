We list a small number of our [customers](https://balsamiq.com/company/customers/) on our website as examples of organizations using our software. 

If you don’t want us to mention your company name at all, just [let us know](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=No PR) and we’ll add you to our list of companies requesting to not be party to any disclosures or forms of publicity (including our customer lists on our website). This is compliant with section [17 (b) of our EULA](https://balsamiq.com/eulas/desktopandserverplugins/#17).
