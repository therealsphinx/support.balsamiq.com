Currently, customers can purchase plugin licenses for Atlassian Confluence Server and JIRA Server via [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/) or via our website.

This article is designed to help customers who wish to transfer their existing Mockups for Confluence Server or Mockups for JIRA Server from Balsamiq to their myAtlassian account.

## Who Is Eligible to Move Licenses to Atlassian Marketplace?

Customers who wish to migrate their Mockups for Confluence Server or Mockups for JIRA Server license to Atlassian Marketplace must fit two requirements:

*   You must be using Confluence and/or JIRA Server via **Atlassian Server** (behind-the-firewall). Atlassian Cloud customers, please [see below](#i-m-using-atlassian-cloud-can-i-migrate-to-marketplace-now).
*   You must have **a matching license or be willing to upgrade to matching** in Marketplace. Currently, plugin licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq do not have to match. For example, you can register a Balsamiq-issued 10-editor Mockups for Confluence license on a 100-user Confluence installation. However, Marketplace requires that add-on licenses match server levels.

## Why Should I Migrate My License to Marketplace?

Once you have migrated your license to your myAtlassian account you will be able to:

*   Purchase maintenance and upgrades via Atlassian Marketplace (you'll no longer need to deal with two separate vendors, and two separate terms and purchasing systems).
*   Synchronize your Balsamiq add-on's renewal dates with your other licenses.
*   Purchase more than one year of maintenance at a time.
