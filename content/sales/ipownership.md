Yes.

Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created with any of our products. If you'd like to read the full terms for each product, you can find direct links below:

* [EULA](https://balsamiq.com/eulas/desktopandserverplugins/#15) **(Mockups for Desktop, for Confluence Server and for JIRA Server)**
* [Terms of Service](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/#who-owns-the-ip-of-my-wireframes-and-assets) **(myBalsamiq)**
* [Hosted Plugin Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/hostedpluginstos/#intellectual-property-rights) **(Mockups for Google Drive, for Confluence Cloud and for JIRA Cloud)**


That said, if you use images created with Balsamiq Mockups in a **book**, **eBook**, **website**, **software,** or **advertisement**, we'd appreciate a little mention, something small like this:

_<small>Created with [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/).</small>_

Here's the HTML for it:

<textarea class="full" rows="2"><em><small> Created with <a href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq Mockups</a>.</small></em></textarea>

Peldi's wife Mariah and our nice guy designer Mike have put a lot of love into creating those wireframe pieces, they deserve a little credit don't you think?

If instead you want to use any of the **icons** found in Balsamiq Mockups, the credit should go to <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">FontAwesome</a>. Here's a link to their very generous <a href="http://fontawesome.io/license/">license</a>.

Thanks! :)
