The answer depends on the version of Balsamiq Mockups:

*   [Subscriptions](#subscriptions) - myBalsamiq, Balsamiq for Google Drive, Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud and Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud.
*   [Licenses](#licenses) - Mockups 3 for Desktop, Mockups for Confluence Server, and Mockups for JIRA Server.

* * *

## Subscriptions

We only accept [automatic credit card payments](/sales/ordering/) for myBalsamiq and Balsamiq for Google Drive plans. We do not accept other forms of payment for these subscription-based services.

Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud and Mockups 3 JIRA Cloud are sold via [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/).

* * *

## Licenses

All licenses for Mockups 3 for Desktop, Mockups for Confluence Server, and Mockups for JIRA Server can be purchased by **credit card,** (including MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express) via our [secure](/sales/safe/) online [order form](https://balsamiq.com/buy/).

We unfortunately [do not accept PayPal](/sales/nopaypal) as a form of payment, however most debit cards with a Visa or MasterCard logo (and that do not require a PIN) are accepted.

For orders of US $300 or more we also accept additional payment options. Our Terms are Net 30\. Details on how to submit your order are [here](/sales/ordering/). Once you have received your invoice, you will be able to pay using the options below.

### Electronic Fund Transfer

Bank information is provided with your invoice.

Please **reference the Balsamiq invoice number in the transaction**, or we will not be able to match the payment with your order.

Payment is to be made in US Dollars for the full amount remitted to our bank.

When you make an international bank (wire) transfer, please designate OUR option. (We do not accept BEN or SHA transactions.)

Any additional fees are the sole responsibility of your company.

### Credit Card (Invoices)

For your [added security](/sales/safe/), we do not handle card numbers or process credit cards ourselves.

If you have been issued an invoice, and you decide to pay by credit card instead of check or EFT, you can enter your credit card information easily and quickly from the "Pay Invoice" link shown on your online invoice.

To access your online invoice, simply click on the link provided with your order.

All other credit card payments for licenses should be made on our **[website](https://balsamiq.com/buy/).**
