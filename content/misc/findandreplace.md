We totally understand how useful it would be to have a find and replace feature in Mockups. Truth is, we have tried to implement it in the past but it caused too much instability to our code structure and we decided to postpone it.

## Will Your Apps Ever Get Find and Replace?

Good news! This one is definitely on our roadmap, and it is something that should be a lot easier once our apps are running on native frameworks. In the meantime, feel free to [add your vote for the request](https://forums.balsamiq.com/t/feature-request-text-find-replace/157) so we can prioritize it for the future.

Also, stay tuned to our [blog](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/). As soon as we have find and replace ready to use, we will announce it there!
