Occasionally, you may find the that number of projects you see on a myBalsamiq site doesn't match the amount of active projects listed at the bottom of the page. This is most likely because you don't have permission to view all of the projects on the site.

By default, only the Site Owner has [permission](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/accesscontrolmatrix/) to see all of the projects on a site. Staff members also have this ability, if granted by the Site Owner.

If you are the Site Owner and the numbers don't match, please [get in touch](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/t/myb) and we will get it sorted!
