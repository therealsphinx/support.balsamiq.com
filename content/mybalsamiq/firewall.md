Not at the moment. A behind the firewall version is not in the plans, but maybe a private-cloud one could be a possibility.

[Let us know if you’d like to chat about it](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com). In the meantime, you might want to look into [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups) instead.

You might also be interested in ["Who can see my wireframes?"](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/#who-can-see-my-wireframes) or learning more about [myBalsamiq security](/mybalsamiq/secure/).
