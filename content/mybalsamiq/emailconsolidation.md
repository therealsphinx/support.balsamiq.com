Do you have two email addresses, each associated with a myBalsamiq site? Do you want to consolidate your myBalsamiq credentials and only use a single email address? This guide is for you.

Say your email address _old@foo.com_ is associated with a site we'll call _Old_, and your new email address (_new@foo.com_) is associated with a site we'll call _New_.

## If You Are a Site Owner of Both Sites

To transfer ownership of Old to new@foo.com, do the following:

1.  Log on to Old as old@foo.com and invite new@foo.com as a Staff member
2.  Using a different browser (for convenience), accept the invitation.
3.  Now back on old@foo.com, make new@foo.com the site owner, and log out.
4.  In the other browser, go to the Settings / Staff page and remove old@foo.com from the site.
5.  Done! Now new@foo.com will be the owner of both sites.

## If You Are Not a Site Owner

First of all, ask the site owner of each myBalsamiq site you're a Staff member of to invite new@foo.com as a staff member and to remove old@foo.com staff member.

For projects, do this: log on as old@foo.com and do the following for each myBalsamiq site you have access to:

1.  Visit the Settings / Projects page.
2.  For each project, ask the project owner (you'll see their name on the list) to invite new@foo.com to the project and to remove old@foo.com.
3.  Accept any invitations from new@foo.com.
4.  Done!
