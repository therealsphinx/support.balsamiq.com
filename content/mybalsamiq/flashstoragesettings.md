The Adobe Flash Player may be set to ask you every time a site wants to save more than 10K of local data to your computer's storage. When that happens you'll see a dialog like the one below and have to click the Allow every time.

You can change this setting to allow more than the minimum, and additionally you can set it to always allow myBalsamiq to store temporary files needed to run the editor. Here's how you do it.

## Change Local Storage Size for assets.mybalsamiq.com

You should only need to make this change once. The data is saved in your browser's cookies.

1.  Open the myBalsamiq editor by editing a Mockup.
2.  Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) the editor while it is running.  
    **IMPORTANT:** if right-clicking freezes your editor, please use [Adobe's Local Storage Settings page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) instead. Just scroll down the list to assets.mybalsamiq.com and increase the limit to unlimited.
3.  From the context menu, select Settings, and then click the Local Storage tab (folder icon).
4.  In the Local Storage tab, set the slider to unlimited.
