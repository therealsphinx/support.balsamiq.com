Occasionally, Windows users may run into an error where the Mockups 3 installer fails silently. There may be a message about preparing to install before the application closes, or there may be no message at all. This FAQ should help you get back up and running with Mockups 3.

## Install Adobe Air

The first thing to try is to [download and install Adobe Air](https://get.adobe.com/air/) first. Adobe Air is included in the Mockups 3 installer, but it failing will cause the whole installation to fail. Installing it first, and then trying to run the installer, will mitigate that issue.
