If you have a Mockups file that you want to use as a Symbol (a file [downloaded from Mockups To Go](/tutorials/mockupstogo/), for example), here's how you can add it to myBalsamiq as a Project Asset.

* * *

## 1\. Locate the Mockups File on Your Computer

![Locate the Mockups file on your computer](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_myBalsamiq/media_1380045665749.png)

If you downloaded it from Mockups To Go, it may be in your Downloads folder.

## 2\. Open the myBalsamiq Project You'd like to Use the Symbol(S) With

[![Open the myBalsamiq project you'd like to use the Symbol with](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_myBalsamiq/media_1380067485683.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_myBalsamiq/media_1380067485683_lg.png "2\. Open the myBalsamiq project you'd like to use the Symbol with")

## 3\. Click on the Assets Link at the Top of the Page

This will open a new window with the the Project Assets tab selected.

**Note:** the Project Assets tab refers to the specific project you are in. If you want to make a Symbol available to _all_ Mockups projects, you can do that by uploading files to the [_Site Assets_](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/assets/) tab.

Once you've selected the file, after a few seconds you'll see a preview of the Mockups file you just uploaded.
