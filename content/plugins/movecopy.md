Sometimes you might want to copy or move a mockup from one Google Drive project to another. To do so, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window)
2.  In the source project, select the mockup you want to copy or move.
3.  In the Project menu, select Export > Mockup to JSON. This will put a text-based representation of the mockup in the clipboard.
4.  In the target project, select Import > Mockup JSON... from the Project menu.
5.  In the Import Mockup dialog that pops up, paste the contents of the clipboard with CTRL+V and click the Import button.

That's it! You may now delete the mockup from the source project if you wish.
