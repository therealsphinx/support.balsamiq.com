Something not working as expected? We're here to help! Here's a short list of steps we recommend.

## 1\. Check Your Version

If you've hit a bug there's a decent chance we've fixed it in a recent update. Start by checking the [**download page**](https://balsamiq.com/download/) to make sure you're running the latest version.

## 2\. Check the Docs 

If your problem isn't a bug or the application crashing you may find the answer to your question in our documentation. You might want to start with our [**desktop application FAQs**](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/) or maybe [these FAQs about **installation, licensing and purchasing**](/). Or you can [**search**](https://balsamiq.com/search/) all our docs.

## 3\. Contact Us

Get a human! Answering your questions is part of everyone's job here at Balsamiq. Email [**support@balsamiq.com**](mailto:support@balsamiq.com) or find more ways to [contact us here](https://balsamiq.com/company/#contact).

### Send Us Your Log Files

If you uncover something we haven't seen before or something especially tricky we might ask you to send us your log file. If so, here are the steps you should follow:

1.  Open your Local Store folder by opening the "About"  dialog and clicking on the "Open Local Store Folder" link ([see pictures here](/desktop/localstore/))
2.  Quit the application - _**but don't restart it**_
3.  Email us the file called "BalsamiqMockups3.log"
