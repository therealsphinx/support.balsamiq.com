Not directly, no.

There are too many technologies for a small company like ours to keep track of and export to, so we don’t plan on adding export capabilities natively any time soon.

There are some projects which extend Balsamiq Mockups in various ways; you can find them on our [extensions page](/resources/extensions/).

If you’d like to write an extension for Mockups, [do get in touch](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com), we’d love to help you as much as we can.
