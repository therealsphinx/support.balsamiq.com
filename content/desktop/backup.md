Mockups 3 for Desktop backs up any file you open to a local folder. These local versions are stored for (around) seven days and should automatically load in case of a corrupted project file.

Versions of [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download) prior to 3.4 do not have the automatic recovery feature. This FAQ will show you how to recover the file manually.

## How Do I Find This Backup?

The backups are all stored in Mockups' Local Store, in a folder called LocalProjects. You can get there via the Balsamiq Mockups "About" dialog.

There is more information about finding your Local Store [here](/desktop/localstore/).

## How Do I Restore a File from This Backup Folder?

Restoring a file is super easy!

Once you are in the Local Store folder, find the project that you would like to restore, and double click it. That will open it in Mockups 3 for Desktop. From there, Select Project > Save As and save the file in a new location. Saving it allows both the backup and a new version of the file to exist, which keeps your data safe!

**Note: **We do not recommend moving files out of the Local Store folder. If you want to move a backed up file to another folder, we recommend copying the file (CTRL/CMD+C), and then pasting it to the destination (CTRL/CMD+V).

## That's Awesome! My Only Problem Is That I Don't Know Which File Is the One I Want to Restore.

Starting with Mockups for Desktop 3.3, backup files should have a small snippet of the original file's name. Before that, however, backup files were named randomly. If you haven't updated to the latest version (you [should](https://balsamiq.com/download), we are always adding cool things!) you can set your Local Store folder to arrange the files by date. That will give you a pretty good idea which file you are looking for, even if the names aren't any help!
